# 32 - Security Constraints

> Category: **Image Delivery Protocol** (`docs/IMAGE-DELIVERY-PROTOCOL/`) &nbsp;|&nbsp; Status: Draft specification &nbsp;|&nbsp; Owner: TBD

## Purpose

Enumerate parameter-level security constraints specific to the delivery protocol, layered on top of (not duplicating) `docs/SECURITY/`.

## Category Mandate

This is the platform's primary contract, on equal footing with API/ -- not a sub-topic of it. It defines the wire-level protocol that connects asset -> transformation -> cache -> CDN -> consumer: the canonical URL format, every transformation parameter and how they compose, the transformation pipeline order, derivative identity, cache-key derivation, and HTTP-level delivery semantics (caching, conditional requests, range requests, content negotiation). API/10-ASSET-API.md and API/11-UPLOAD-API.md govern how an asset is *managed*; this category governs how an asset is *consumed*. The two must never define the same parameter differently -- where they overlap (e.g. IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md vs. this category's 03/04), API/13-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md defers to this category as the normative source and simply references it.

## Key Topics To Specify

- Bound every numeric parameter (`w`, `h`, `dpr`, `q`) to a hard max to prevent a single request from forcing pathologically expensive processing -- this is a delivery-protocol-level defense distinct from, and in addition to, upload-time validation in `docs/SECURITY/13-UPLOAD-SECURITY.md`.
- Confirm signed-URL verification (`21-SIGNED-URL-PROTOCOL.md`) happens before any processing work is scheduled, so an invalid signature cannot be used to trigger paid compute even if the final response is rejected.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every parameter/rule this document defines has exactly one authoritative source -- if `docs/API/13-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md` or another document also describes it, one defers to the other explicitly, they never silently disagree.
- [ ] Every rule is testable by an automated conformance test (see `37-PROTOCOL-TESTING.md`) or explicitly marked operational-only.
- [ ] Cross-references to related documents are correct and bidirectional.

## Open Questions

- Confirm parameter naming (`w` vs `width`, `q` vs `quality`) against whatever convention `docs/API/01-API-STANDARDS.md` settles on before implementation locks it in.
- Flag any decision here that should be promoted to a MEMORY/DECISIONS.md ADR once made.
