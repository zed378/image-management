# 24 - Error & Fallback

> Category: **Image Delivery Protocol** (`docs/IMAGE-DELIVERY-PROTOCOL/`) &nbsp;|&nbsp; Status: Draft specification &nbsp;|&nbsp; Owner: TBD

## Purpose

Define the response for every failure mode specific to delivery: unknown asset, invalid/unsupported transformation, processing failure, and (optionally) a fallback/placeholder image behavior.

## Category Mandate

This is the platform's primary contract, on equal footing with API/ -- not a sub-topic of it. It defines the wire-level protocol that connects asset -> transformation -> cache -> CDN -> consumer: the canonical URL format, every transformation parameter and how they compose, the transformation pipeline order, derivative identity, cache-key derivation, and HTTP-level delivery semantics (caching, conditional requests, range requests, content negotiation). API/10-ASSET-API.md and API/11-UPLOAD-API.md govern how an asset is *managed*; this category governs how an asset is *consumed*. The two must never define the same parameter differently -- where they overlap (e.g. IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md vs. this category's 03/04), API/13-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md defers to this category as the normative source and simply references it.

## Key Topics To Specify

- Unknown or soft-deleted `asset_id` -> `404`, no distinction visible to an unauthenticated caller between "never existed" and "deleted" (avoids leaking existence).
- Invalid transformation parameter -> `400` with the specific parameter and reason named in the error body, per `docs/API/05-ERROR-HANDLING.md`'s envelope.
- Define whether an optional `fallback=` (a consumer-supplied backup asset ID or a platform default placeholder) is supported for graceful degradation in consumer-facing image grids -- if offered, it must be explicit opt-in, never a silent default that masks a real error from monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every parameter/rule this document defines has exactly one authoritative source -- if `docs/API/13-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md` or another document also describes it, one defers to the other explicitly, they never silently disagree.
- [ ] Every rule is testable by an automated conformance test (see `37-PROTOCOL-TESTING.md`) or explicitly marked operational-only.
- [ ] Cross-references to related documents are correct and bidirectional.

## Open Questions

- Confirm parameter naming (`w` vs `width`, `q` vs `quality`) against whatever convention `docs/API/01-API-STANDARDS.md` settles on before implementation locks it in.
- Flag any decision here that should be promoted to a MEMORY/DECISIONS.md ADR once made.
