# 37 - Protocol Conformance Testing

> Category: **Image Delivery Protocol** (`docs/IMAGE-DELIVERY-PROTOCOL/`) &nbsp;|&nbsp; Status: Draft specification &nbsp;|&nbsp; Owner: TBD

## Purpose

Define a conformance test suite any image-engine implementation must pass -- this is what makes the engine genuinely swappable, not just theoretically so.

## Category Mandate

This is the platform's primary contract, on equal footing with API/ -- not a sub-topic of it. It defines the wire-level protocol that connects asset -> transformation -> cache -> CDN -> consumer: the canonical URL format, every transformation parameter and how they compose, the transformation pipeline order, derivative identity, cache-key derivation, and HTTP-level delivery semantics (caching, conditional requests, range requests, content negotiation). API/10-ASSET-API.md and API/11-UPLOAD-API.md govern how an asset is *managed*; this category governs how an asset is *consumed*. The two must never define the same parameter differently -- where they overlap (e.g. IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md vs. this category's 03/04), API/13-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md defers to this category as the normative source and simply references it.

## Key Topics To Specify

- A fixed corpus of (input image, parameter set) -> (expected output dimensions, format, and a perceptual-hash/checksum tolerance) pairs covering every `fit`/`g`/`format` combination named in this category.
- Require any future engine adapter (e.g. replacing Sharp) to pass this exact suite before being considered a valid replacement -- link this requirement into `docs/TESTING/04-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-TESTING.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every parameter/rule this document defines has exactly one authoritative source -- if `docs/API/13-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION-API.md` or another document also describes it, one defers to the other explicitly, they never silently disagree.
- [ ] Every rule is testable by an automated conformance test (see `37-PROTOCOL-TESTING.md`) or explicitly marked operational-only.
- [ ] Cross-references to related documents are correct and bidirectional.

## Open Questions

- Confirm parameter naming (`w` vs `width`, `q` vs `quality`) against whatever convention `docs/API/01-API-STANDARDS.md` settles on before implementation locks it in.
- Flag any decision here that should be promoted to a MEMORY/DECISIONS.md ADR once made.
